# dotfiles

## About

This repo is a collection of all my dotfiles that I use and have configured. The applications which I have configured are Vim, tmux and zsh. This repo contains my .vimrc, .tmux.conf and my .zshrc. Additionally, using oh-my-zsh I have also included the honukai theme which I have modified.

## Installation 

To install all the settings that my dotfiles have, all that is necessary is the install.sh file. This can be downloaded individually or with the entire repo. Once cloned, simply cd to the repo and run 

	./install.sh

This will install everything that is need if it is not already installed and create symlinks between the ~/.vimrc, ,~/.tmux.conf and ~/.zshrc. 

NOTE: The script will clone this repo again and so really only the install.sh file is needed to get all the settings.
